# Lucidity

By [@Jacob Huang](https://github.com/23JacobH) and [@Samarth Shridhar](https://github.com/sam-shridhar1950f).

Lucidity helps you avoid fast fashion and explore sustainable alternatives on the world's largest marketplace.

## Overview
Lucidity combs through Amazon results in batches and checks a few factors to determine whether each clothing item is considered "fast fashion": fabric materials, ratios of said materials, clothing manufacturers, and price. If items are deemed fast fashion, they are flagged. For flagged items, links to eBay, Facebook Marketplace, and Depop are provided to encourage shopping secondhand if such items are still desired.

### Features
* Automatic Detection: Seamlessly scans Amazon listings without any manual activation.
* Batch Processing: Optimized algorithm for fast, concurrent analysis of multiple products.
* Sustainable Alternatives: Provides direct links to secondhand marketplaces for flagged items.
* User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design that integrates smoothly with your browsing experience.
